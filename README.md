# Aquaero USB Implementation

This is a project that controls the Aquaero 6 directly through its USB HID reports. It is meant to eventually be an alternative to the official Aquasuite app. Current state of the project is still gathering data by decompiling the Aquasuite DLL's and using a USB sniffer to monitor the report traffic. Also, quick tests are being created to verify functionality, and can be tested from the browser at http://localhost:8080/.
