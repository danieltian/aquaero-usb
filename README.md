# Aquaero USB Implementation
----------------------------
This is a project that controls the Aquaero 5 directly through its USB HID reports. It is meant to eventually be an alternative to the official Aquasuite app. Current state of the project is still gathering data by decompiling the Aquasuite DLL's and using a USB sniffer to monitor the report traffic.
