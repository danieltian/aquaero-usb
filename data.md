### Output Report ID 7 - Update Software Temps (17 bytes)

Report ID 7 followed by 8 int16's which corresponds to the 8 possible software temperature sensors. Values should be in Celsius, multiplied by 100 (so 50 degrees becomes 5,000). Up to two digits of precision is supported. All 8 sensors must be sent at once. Any sensor that doesn't have a value should be sent as 0x7FFF (decimal value 32767, a.k.a. the maximum value of an int16).

Example: We have the temperature readings 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 for the first 5 sensors.

```
       |- 1000 -|  |- 2000 -|  |- 3000 -|  |- 4000 -|  |- 5000 -|  | 32767 |   | 32767 |   | 32767 |
[0x07, 0x03, 0xE8, 0x07, 0xD0, 0x0B, 0xB8, 0x0F, 0xA0, 0x13, 0x88, 0x7F, 0xFF, 0x7F, 0xFF, 0x7F, 0xFF]
```

### Output Report ID 10 - Update Software Temp Name (28 bytes)

Report ID 10 followed by an int16 that represents the software sensor to update (starts at 32, increments by 1 up to 40 for all 8 sensors). Then followed by 0x00, then a 24-byte string for the name where the last byte is 0x00 (allowing for 23 characters total). Any unused characters should be set to 0x00. The Aquaero 6 supports the complete Latin1 character set (also known as ISO 8859-1) minus the very last character, Ã¿. Sending data that uses another encoding such as UTF8 or Windows-1252 will treat it as if it's the Latin1 character set, which can result in [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).

Example: We set software sensor 32 with the string 'abcde':

```
       |-- 32 --|         a     b     c     d     e
[0x0A, 0x00, 0x20, 0x00, 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64, 0x65, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]
```

### Output Report ID 6, Sync Time Commmand (7 bytes)

Setting the time: Report ID followed by an int16 with value 37,000, which is the sync time command. The time should follow as a uint32 where the time is the number of seconds that has elapsed since 2009-01-01 00:00:00.

Example: We set the time:

```
       |- 37000 -| | 2016-10-07 11:38:00 |
[0x06, 0x90, 0x88, 0x57, 0xF8, 0x15, 0x7C]
```

### Feature Report ID 11, Mega Settings (2048 bytes used out of 2653 bytes total)

Mega settings file

| Hex Offset | Decimal offset | Data type | Range | Description |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 0x0000 | 0 | uint8 | Always 11 | Report ID |
| 0x0001 | 1 | uint16 | Structure ID 1200, will be valid for firmware versions 2000 to 2007 and likely beyond |
| 0x0003 | 3 | uint32 | Aquaero timestamp, this value seems to be ignored, use report ID 6's sync time command to update the time instead |
| 0x0007 | 7 | int16 | Clock offset, this seems to always be 0 and is ignored, the actual UTC offset is controlled at 0x46 instead |
| 0x0009 | 9 | int16 x 8 | Key sensitivity settings for all 8 keys, seems to be all 0's for the Aquaero 5 Pro, which has physical keys instead of touch keys |
| 0x0019 | 25 | uint8 | Interface type, always seems to be 3, unknown what this value is for |
| 0x001A | 26 | uint8 | Language type (0 for English, 1 for German) |
| 0x001B | 27 | uint16 | Screen contrast when active, this number is a percentage from 0% to 100% multiplied by 100, so 40% would be 4,000 |
| 0x001D | 29 | uint16 | Screen contrast when on standby, this number is a percentage from 0% to 100% multiplied by 100, so 40% would be 4,000 |
| 0x001F | 31 | uint16 | Backlight brightness when active, this number is a percentage from 0% to 100% multiplied by 100, so 40% would be 4,000 |
| 0x0021 | 33 | uint16 | Backlight brightness when on standby, this number is a percentage from 0% to 100% multiplied by 100, so 40% would be 4,000 |
